#vulnerability 

ARP Poisoning (also known as ARP Spoofing) is a type of cyber attack carried out over a Local Area Network (LAN) that involves sending malicious ARP packets to a default gateway on a LAN in order to change the pairings in its IP to MAC address table. ARP Protocol translates IP addresses into MAC addresses. Because the ARP protocol was designed purely for efficiency and not for security, ARP Poisoning attacks are extremely easy to carry out as long as the attacker has control of a machine within the target LAN or is directly connected to it.

The attack itself consists of an attacker sending a false ARP reply message to the default network gateway, informing it that his or her MAC address should be associated with his or her target's IP address (and vice-versa, so his or her target's MAC is now associated with the attacker's IP address). Once the default gateway has received this message and broadcasts its changes to all other devices on the network, all of the target's traffic to any other device on the network travels through the attacker's computer, allowing the attacker to inspect or modify it before forwarding it to its real destination
