WMAP is a feature-rich web application vulnerability scanner that was originally created from a tool named SQLMap. This tool is integrated with Metasploit and allows us to conduct web application scanning from within the Metasploit Framework.

WMAP is available as an [[metasploit]] MSF plugin and can be loaded directly into MSF
`load wmap`
`wmap_sites -a <url>`
`wmap_targets -t <urls>`
`wmap_run -t `
`wmap_run -e`
