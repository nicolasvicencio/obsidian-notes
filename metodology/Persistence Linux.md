Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access.

Gaining an initial foothold is not enough, you need to setup and maintain persistent access to your targets

The persistence techniques we can utilize will depend on the target configuration

We can utilize various post exploitation persistence modules to ensure that we always have access to the Target system
