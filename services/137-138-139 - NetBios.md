NETBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is a legacy network protocol that enables communication between computers and devices within a local area network (LAN). Originally developed by IBM in the early 1980s, NETBIOS was widely used in earlier versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems and networks. Its primary purpose is to provide a simple and straightforward method for sharing files, printers, and other resources within a LAN.

NETBIOS typically runs over transport protocols such as TCP/IP, using protocols like NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP) to transmit data packets. This combination allows NETBIOS to provide communication services while leveraging the underlying routing and addressing capabilities of TCP/IP.
