The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) is a [client-server](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/client-server-network) communication [protocol](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/protocol) used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a [network](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/network). It can also carry transaction protocols for interprocess communication. Over the years, SMB has been used primarily to connect Windows computers, although most other systems -- such as Linux and macOS -- also include client components for connecting to SMB resources.
