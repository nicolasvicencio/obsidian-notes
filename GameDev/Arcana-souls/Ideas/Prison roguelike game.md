The Eternal Detention Facility
History:

In a desolate corner of the world, buried beneath layers of secrecy and reinforced concrete, lies the Eternal Detention Facility, a prison unlike any other. Established during a time of great upheaval, the facility was built by a shadowy coalition of governments and corporations, driven by a desire to contain those they deemed beyond redemption. Its construction was shrouded in mystery, with rumors of dark science and forbidden experiments fueling the public's imagination.

The Immortality Curse:

The prison's most notorious feature is its cursed immortality. Each inmate is condemned to an unending cycle of torment and escape attempts. An enigmatic, ancient artifact known as the "Eternity Stone" was discovered and embedded deep within the prison’s core. This stone was believed to grant eternal life but at a horrifying cost: anyone who dies within the prison’s walls is resurrected at the base level, forced to begin their escape anew.

Legend tells that the Eternity Stone was once used in arcane rituals by a secretive cult, who sought to achieve immortality for themselves. When their dark experiments went awry, they were trapped in their own creation, becoming the first inhabitants of the Eternal Detention Facility. Over time, their story became a twisted legend, and the facility became a place of endless suffering for those who found themselves imprisoned there.

The Facility's Structure:

The Eternal Detention Facility is divided into five increasingly dangerous levels, each designed with complex traps, formidable guards, and intricate puzzles. The deeper you go, the more treacherous the environment becomes. The design of the levels reflects the twisted minds of its creators, each one a nightmarish gauntlet of obstacles and threats.

Level One - The Holding Cells: The starting point of the prison. Simple and guarded, it serves as a testing ground for new inmates.

Level Two - The Workshop: An industrial area filled with machinery, tools, and the remnants of past failed escape attempts. It's more dangerous, with hidden traps and surveillance.

Level Three - The Wastelands: A chaotic, crumbling sector of the prison, overrun by hostile factions and environmental hazards.

Level Four - The Labyrinth: A maze of ever-shifting corridors and rooms, with illusions and psychological traps designed to disorient and frustrate escapees.

Level Five - The Core: The most challenging and enigmatic level, housing the prison’s central control and the Eternity Stone itself. Here, the trials become almost insurmountable, and the final escape routes are heavily guarded.

The Immortal Inmates:

The prisoners of the Eternal Detention Facility are not ordinary criminals. They are individuals with unique skills, extraordinary abilities, or unsettling knowledge. Some have accepted their fate, while others continually strive to escape, driven by a fierce will to be free. Over time, these inmates have formed alliances, rivalries, and even cults, adding layers of intrigue and danger to the already perilous environment.

The Escapees' Dilemma:

For the immortals who attempt to escape, the challenge is not just physical but psychological. The constant cycle of death and resurrection wears on their minds, and each failure can lead to despair or enlightenment. Some seek to understand the nature of their curse, others aim to destroy the Eternity Stone, while a few simply wish to find a way to break the cycle and attain true freedom.

Conclusion:

The Eternal Detention Facility remains a place of endless challenge and mystery. Its dark history and the curse of immortality keep its inmates trapped in a perpetual struggle. Each escape attempt is a new chapter in a never-ending story, where every defeat is a chance to learn and every victory a step closer to freedom.
