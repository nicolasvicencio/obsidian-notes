#network

Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across networks from the command line. Ncat was written for the Nmap Project as a much-improved reimplementation of the venerableÂ [Netcat](https://sectools.org/tool/netcat/). It uses both TCP and UDP for communication and is designed to be a reliable back-end tool to instantly provide network connectivity to other applications and users. Ncat will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user with a virtually limitless number of potential uses.

# usage

nc -nlvp <ip_adress> -p <port>
```

```bash
echo "this is my message" > nc localhost <port>
```

```bash
