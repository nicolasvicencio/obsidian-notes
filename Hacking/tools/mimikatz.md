Mimikatz is an open-source tool that hackers use to steal credentials and other sensitive data from compromised Windows computers. It breaks Windows functionality and allows malicious users to access a systemâ€™s memory and security tokens, such as Kerberos tickets, which later can be used to gain unauthorized access to restricted information.
