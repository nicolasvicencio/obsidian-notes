Pass-the-hash is an exploitation technique that involves capturing or harvesting NTLM hashes or clear text passwords and utilizing them to authenticate with the target legitimately.

We can use multiple tools to facilitate a Pass the hash attack:
- [[metasploit]] PsExec module
- [[crackmapexec]]

This technique will allow us to obtain access to the target system via legitimate credentials as opposed to obtaining access via service exploitation.
