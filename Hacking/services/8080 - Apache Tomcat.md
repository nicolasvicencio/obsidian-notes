Apache Tomcat, also known as Tomcat Server, proves to be a popular choice for web developers building and maintaining dynamic websites and applications based on the Java software platform. It's reportedly called 'Tomcat' web server because the founder saw it as an animal that could take care of and fend for itself.

The standard Apache HTTP web server is used to host static and dynamic website or web applications, typically developed in PHP.

Apache Tomcat v8.5.19 is vulnerable to  remote code execution vulnerability that could potentially allow an attacker to upload and execute a ISP payload in order to gain remote access to the target server
